From Foodiebay to a Food Tech Giant: The 
Zomato Saga 
The Evolution of Zomato 
The story of Zomato began in 2008 when Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah were 
working at 
Bain & Company. They have identified a problem: the time-consuming 
process of ordering food in the office. The initial challenge led to the development of 
FoodieBay, a website that helps Bain employees easily access restaurant menus. 
FoodieBay was officially formed in January 2010. Later that same year, it changed its 
name to Zomato. 
 
The year 2015 witnessed a crucial evolution in Zomato's business model with the launch 
of its food delivery service in India. In 2018, it launched Hyperpure, a B2B venture 
focused on supplying high-quality food ingredients to restaurants. In 2022, Zomata 
entered the quick commerce market by purchasing 
Blinkit.
