## Problem Statement:  
**What Medi Buddy Solves**

Despite significant advances in AI and healthcare technology, there is still a lack of **domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs)** for medical applications. Key issues include:

- Inaccurate and unreliable responses to specialized medical queries
- Lack of real-time updates based on the latest medical research and news
- Inadequate tools to help researchers, doctors, and users analyze medical reports in depth

This gap **limits the effectiveness** of AI in healthcare and impacts the reliability of information available to professionals and the public.

## Our Solution:  
**Medi Buddy â€“ A Domain-Specific Medical Agent**

We are building a specialized **medical LLM agent** that can:

- **Accurately answer** a wide range of medical-related questions
- **Provide real-time updates** on the latest medical research and news
- **Assist in analyzing complex medical reports** for researchers, doctors, and regular users

By combining state-of-the-art NLP techniques with **continuously updated medical knowledge**, our solution aims to:

- Bridge the current gap
- Improve the **accessibility, reliability, and impact** of AI in the healthcare sector

## Challenges We Faced

### 1. Chat Feature Development

While integrating the chat feature using **Groq** (initially planned with **OpenRouter**), we faced the following issues:

- A **bug** caused the **Deep Research** feature to malfunction â€” it could no longer properly think and analyze scraped data.

### 2. Changes Implemented

- Temporarily **limited the scraping capabilities** to maintain system stability.
- Despite the bug, we **cannot revert to OpenRouter** because:
  - **Groq is approximately 100Ã— faster** than OpenRouter.
  
We are actively working on a fix to **restore full functionality** while maintaining the performance benefits Groq offers.
